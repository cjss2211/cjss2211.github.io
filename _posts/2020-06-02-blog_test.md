It works not just for text, but also for images:

```python
#Image.open('../fast.ai/images/fast_template/image2.png').flip_lr()

Image.open('/home/cristiansouza/Documents/NLP/Images/nlp.jpg')
```

...and plots:

```python
plt.plot([1,2]);
```

You can also paste images, such as screenshots, directly into a markdown cell in Jupyter. This creates a file embedded in the notebook that Jupyter calls an "attachment". Or you can use Markdown to refer to an image on the internet by its URL.
